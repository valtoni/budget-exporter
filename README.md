# Budget Exporter

Budget Exporter is a browser‑extension project that helps you export bank transactions to a clean, YNAB‑ready CSV in seconds. It includes a rules engine to standardize payee names, optional auto‑categorization, and a friendly management UI. The codebase currently targets Firefox (WebExtensions) and also provides a modern MV3 skeleton under the budget-exporter directory for Chrome/Edge.

What it does
- Scrapes transactions from supported bank pages
- Cleans payee names (plain text or regex rules)
- Optionally assigns categories
- Exports a CSV ready to import into YNAB

Status
- Actively evolving; contributions are welcome
